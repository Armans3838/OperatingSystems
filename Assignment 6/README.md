# Sources/Help
For this assignment, I used the following resources:
- I worked with a very robust more advanced version of a similar assignment found online. Doing so helped me to understand the concepts of the assignment better, and I was able to implement them based on that. The link to the source is (here:) [https://github.com/zedtran/VirtualMemoryManagementSim]
- Lucus and Sophie helped me work through this assingment, hence the similarity in our submissions.
- GitHub CoPilot helped with all of this assignment in terms of the syntax and logic. The code was of course conceptualized by myself and Lucus, but the syntax was aided by CoPilot.
- GeeksforGeeks was incredibly helpful in terms of understanding how to break down and get our page numbers and offsets. It was also helpful in terms of understanding how to use the shared memory and semaphores.
