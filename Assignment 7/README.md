# Sources/Help
For this assignment, I used the following resources:
- Lucus and Sophie helped me work through this assingment, hence the similarity in our main methods.
- GitHub CoPilot helped with all of this assignment in terms of the syntax and logic. The code was of course conceptualized by myself and Lucus, but the syntax was aided by CoPilot.
- GeeksforGeeks was incredibly helpful in terms of quickly implementing the algorithms and understanding the concepts behind them. This is in addition to the efficient time function created.
