Programming Assignment 2\

# Program:
The goal of this program is to use fork() and one of the exec* methods in c/c++ to explore how multiple processes are used in a basic shell.

# Sources/Help:
Online sources such as Geeks for Geeks and StackOverflow were used to help understand and explore how the exec* method functions.

In addition, I worked with Max on this assignment.

# Notes:
The biggest issue thus far is that depending on how the permissions are set, our shell may throw a permission denied error.
